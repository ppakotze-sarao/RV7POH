\section{Amplified Procedures}
%\subsection{Power checks}

\subsection{Before starting engine}
When testing the brakes both brake pedals should have a similar feel and a firm resistance after 1/2" of pedal travel.

\subsection{Throttle operation}
Throttle movements from full power to idle or from idle to full power are full range movements. Full range throttle movements must be performed over a minimum time duration of 2 to 3 seconds. Performing a full range throttle movement at a rate of less than 2 seconds is considered a rapid or
instant movement. Performing rapid movements may result in detuned counterweights which may lead to failure of the counterweight lobes and subsequent engine damage.


\subsection{Take off}
The auxiliary fuel pump is normally off during take offs.  If there is evidence of fuel vapour or rough engine operation the pump should be turned on.

Full throttle runups over loose gravel are harmful to propeller tips.  Rolling take offs where the throttle is advance gently is suggested.  

Use full-rich mixture during takeoff or climb. Careful observation of engine temperature instruments should be practiced to ensure the limits specified are never exceeded.
Prior to take off from fields above 3000 ft elevation the mixture should be leaned.


\subsection{Wing flap settings}
Check that the flaps are retracted evenly. When flap is needed to shorten take off runs, no more than 15$^{\circ}$ is suggested.

\subsection{Enroute climb}
Normal climbs are performed with the flaps retracted and the airspeed 5 to 15 kt faster than best rate of climb speed.  Power selected should not be less than 25" MAP and 2500 rpm. Full throttle climb at 2400 RPM and higher is allowed. 

\subsection{Cruise}
Normal cruising is perfromed between 55\% and 75\% power.  
For reduced noise levels the lowest RPM in the green arc for the desired power setting is suggested.

For maximum service life, maintain the following limits are recommended for continuous cruise operation:\\
\begin{itemize}
\item Engine power setting - 65\% of rated or less.
\item Cylinder head temperatures - 400$^{\circ}$F or below.
\item Oil temperature 165$^{\circ}$F to 220$^{\circ}$F.
\end{itemize}
\begin{center}
NOTE\\

After engine rework cruising should be done at 65\% to 75\% power for 50 hours or until oil consumption stabilise.
\end{center}

\subsection{Mixture leaning in flight}
The relationship between Mixture setting and engine power is indicated in Figure~\ref{fig:Leaning_graph}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[height=0.8\textheight]{Leaning_graph.eps}
\caption{Lycoming power leaning curve}
\label{fig:Leaning_graph}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Leaning with Exhaust Gas Temperature (EGT) Gauge}
\subsubsection{Maximum Power Cruise}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Approximately 75\% Power.
\item Never lean beyond 150$^{\circ}$ on RICH side of peak EGT.
\item Monitor cylinder head temperatures.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Best Economy Cruise}
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Approximately 75\% Power and BELOW.
\item Operate at PEAK EGT.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Leaning with Manual Mixture Control}
Economy cruise, 75\% power or less, without flowmeter or EGT guage
\begin{enumerate}[(1)]
\item Slowly move mixture control from FULL RICH position toward lean posittion.
\item Continue leaning until slight loss of power is noted\\ (loss of power may or may not be accompanied by roughness.)
\item Enrich until engine runs moothly and power is regained.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Let down}
Sudden cooling is detrimental to the good health of the aircraft engine. Lycoming Service Instruction 1094D recommends a maximum temperature change of 50${^\circ}$F per minute to avoid shock cooling of the cylinders.

Pilots must avoid fast letdowns with very low power (high-cruise RPM and low manifold pressure), along with rich mixtures that contribute to sudden cooling. It is recommended that pilots maintain at least 15" MAP or higher, and set the RPM at the lowest cruise position. 

Letdown speed should not exceed high cruise speed or approximately 1,000 feet per minute of descent. Keeping descent and airspeed within these limits will help to prevent the sudden cooling that may result in cracked cylinder heads, warped exhaust valves, and bent pushrods.

The mixture setting also has an effect on engine cooling. To reduce spark plug fouling and keep the cylinder cooling within the recommended 50${^\circ}$F per-minute limit, the mixture should be left at the lean setting used for cruise and then richened gradually during the descent from altitude. The lean mixture, maintaining some power and using a sensible airspeed should achieve the most efficient engine temperatures possible.

\subsection{Crosswind Landing }
When landing in a crosswind, use the minimum flap setting required for the field length available.

\subsection{Go-around }
In a go-aroud, apply full throttle and 2700 RPM smoothly using fine pitch.  Reduce wing flaps promptly to climb setting.   Upon reaching a safe airspeed with positive rate of climb flaps should be retracted fully.

\subsection{Cold Weather Operation}
Prior to starting in cold temperatures it is advisable to pull the propeller through several times.  

\begin{center}
NOTE\\

When pulling through the propeller treat it as if the ignition is on.  A loose or broken ground wire to either magento could cause the engine to fire.
\end{center}

\section{Aerobatic Flight}
\subsection{Aerobatic Flight}
The aircraft is capable of easily performing basic aerobatic manoeuvres. This capability is due to its relatively high power loading and aerodynamic cleanliness which produces the speed or energy needed.  Excessive speed build-up can occur very quickly and should be of primary concern when attempting and practicing aerobatics.  Elevator stick forces are relatively light, over stressing could easily occur.  Pilots should received formal aerobatic training before attempting aerobatic flight.

\subsection{Airspeed Aerobatic Manoeuvres}
The aircraft is capable of performing the aerobatic manoeuvres listed in Table~\ref{tab:aero_speeds}.
