\section{General}
This pilot's operating handbook is designed  to provide information relevant to achieve maximum utilisation 
of the aircraft.  It is not designed to be a substitute for adequate and competent flying instruction 
and should not be used for operational purposes unless kept up to date.

Assurance that the aircraft is airworthy is the responsibility of the owner.  The pilot in command is responsible for
ensuring the aircraft is safe for flight and for operating within the limits detailed in this handbook and as displayed on placards and instrument markings in the aircraft.

\section{Three View}
The RV7 is a propeller driven conventional gear aircraft with a wingspan of 7.7m, a length of 6.1m and a height of 1.6m as shown in Figure~\ref{fig:rv-7_3view}.
